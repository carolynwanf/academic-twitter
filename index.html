                <h1>Dialogue on Academic Twitter: An Internet-Related Ethnography</h1>
                <img class='big-image' src='public/Twitter-logo.png'>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>One day in spring of 2021, I was sitting on my sister’s couch while her boyfriend, a theoretical computer scientist, fervently paced the living room.  He was about to publish one of the biggest results of his career so far.  The cause of his pacing? Not the contents of the paper itself or anxiety over its reception (he was certain that it would be big), but the precise wording of a Twitter thread that he was drafting to describe his results to his peers.  The use of Twitter in this way was novel to me.  I had only ever thought of Twitter as a place for passing thoughts, performative argumentation, and keeping up with the latest news in pop culture and current events.  The idea that there was a region of Twitter that catered specifically to academic communication was fascinating, and I wondered how this new medium influenced interactions between academics, if at all.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As dialogue shifts online and the internet bridges physical gaps, the boundaries between the professional and the personal have  become increasingly tenuous.  As it has in the past, this new technical status quo gives rise to new and interesting social dynamics and simultaneously creates more space than ever before for transgression.  As we put ourselves online as part of a networked public, we leave all of our thoughts out on the internet for scrutiny — forever.  For this project, I’ve decided to conduct an internet-related ethnography to examine how this new reality manifests itself for academics both on and offline.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>I will be analyzing the online life of academics through their interactions on and with Twitter.  Although Twitter began as a platform for spontaneous social updates—what you had for lunch, how you felt about the latest episode of the bachelorette, etc.—it’s become much, much, more.  From a source of catharsis and comfort in the wake of disasters to a platform for activism and community organizing, Twitter has become an integral part of our social and emotional lives (Blank, 2013).  For academics, the general affordances of a digital context along with the specific features of Twitter like liking, following, retweeting, commenting, hashtagging, and, of course, tweeting itself, make it easy to create a community for dialogue around specific topics.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Networked publics like Twitter allow for four primary affordances: persistence, replicability, scalability, and searchability (Boyd, pg.  46).  <strong>Persistence</strong> is the ability to preserve the text that one produces long past the original time it was created.  For academics, this allows for the ability to preserve past papers and interactions with those papers in <a href="https://twitter.com/cstheory" >large aggregators</a>.  In general, this removal of content from its context creates a new concern of how it’s perceived without said context.  <strong>Replicability</strong> is the ability to spread, byte for byte and word for word, the exact content of a text.  For academics on Twitter, this allows more established academics to amplify the voices of less established academics by re-tweeting their content to their followers (G/PG 1, Prof 1, Prof 2).  <strong>Scalability</strong> is the potentially broad distribution of content in a networked public.  Again, the ability to re-tweet content allows for important or interesting new results to be distributed and seen on a scale and timeframe not previously possible by just email or word of mouth.  Finally, <strong>searchability</strong> is the ability to access content in networked publics through some kind of sear feature.  This makes it easier to find interesting ideas and relevant content long past they time that they were originally created.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>These affordances introduce new dynamics to navigate, including invisible audiences, a lack of distinct social contexts, the blurring of public and private (Boyd, pg. 49).  An extension of the third dynamic, I will argue, is the blurring of professional and personal.  Twitter and social media in general are inherently personal–they exist for us to express our thoughts, to construct images of ourselves for everyone else to see.  The age-old struggle of balancing personal lives with professional careers comes to a head when an inherently personal platform becomes a useful tool for our jobs.  People are currently in a state of transition as they re-negotiate what professional opinions and work they can put on display while contemporaneously using those same profiles for personal purposes in this new era of pervasive networked publics.</p>

            <section id='methods'>
                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>For this project, I’ll be analyzing two academic communities on Twitter: Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) Twitter, and Climate Science Twitter.  The choice to analyze two distinct communities together instead of just one came from Tom Boellstorf’s book Ethnography in Virtual Worlds, which posits that analyzing two groups in tandem expands and deepens our understanding of each group by both  allowing for a point of comparison for differences and allowing us to draw more substantial conclusions about similarities (Boellstorf, 2012).  The two communities I decided on, Theoretical Computer Science Twitter and Climate Science Twitter, were chosen based on their perceived proximity to wider social causes.  While the results and ideas distributed by Climate Science Twitter have the potential to impact policy and public perception around the climate crisis, most of the results and ideas distributed by Theoretical Computer Science Twitter do not have the same broad social relevance or impact.  I thought that it would be interesting to see how, if at all, the proximity to social causes impacts discourse online.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the online part of this ethnography, I searched keywords on Twitter to find professors, graduate students, and postgraduate students in both fields to see how they interacted with each other on Twitter.  For each field, I collected Tweets and categorized them based on content and attitude.  To gain perspective on how people actually felt about the influence of Twitter in their academic lives (the “related” part of this internet-related ethnography), I interviewed seven people: one undergraduate in theoretical computer science (UG 1), one graduate/postgraduate student in theoretical computer science (G/PG 1), two professors in theoretical computer science (Prof 1, Prof 2), two graduate/postgraduate students in climate science (G/PG 2, G/PG 3), and one professor in climate science (Prof 3).  These interviews were sourced across institutions in an effort to maintain anonymity and gain a broader perspective on the topic. The transcripts for these interviews are available at the bottom of this page.</p>
            </section>

            <section id='tcs twitter'>
                <h2>Theoretical Computer Science Twitter</h2>
                <p>Through observation, I found that Theoretical Computer Science Twitter is, structurally, rather insular.  As a relatively niche topic with a high intellectual barrier to entry, this isn’t very surprising.  Truly understanding the theoretical computer science concepts discussed at the frontiers of discovery requires a high level of math education, an understanding of the current status quo in the field, and an understanding of mathematical jargon, all of which makes it so that the number of people who can actively and productively contribute to conversation is quite small.  Even interested undergraduates just tend to lurk as invisible audience members on the profiles of established academics (G/PG 1, UG 1).  Another cause of the insular nature of TCS Twitter is the high level of effort required to understand the material.  This in and of itself is a deterrent to outsiders.  Take for example, this <a href="https://twitter.com/huckbennett/status/1473058035484356610">tweet</a> on “cryptography from pseudorandom quantum states” that asks, “are there minicrypt primitives that are implied by OWFs but are not (yet) known to be implied by PRs? …the paper seems to construct MACs but not digital signatures.” It’s pretty self-evident that these abbreviations and terms like “minicrypt primitives” and “digital signatures” would be confusing to those without the necessary background.  Even small things like the use of “n” to mean some variable number, as it’s used in this <a href="https://twitter.com/henryquantum/status/1473025284345528320">thread</a> to indicate that the total number of tweets in the thread is finite but yet to be determined, can be confusing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As such, people who are active on Theoretical Computer Science Twitter comprise two primary groups: professors and graduate students/postgraduate students.  I’ve grouped them in this way because of the different attitudes they take when interacting with the platform.  Because professors have stable, tenured positions, they’re less concerned about their reputations and getting along with everyone.  For graduate and postgraduate students, it is beneficial to their future careers for them to present inoffensively, lest they draw the ire of future hiring committee members (G/PG 1).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Observationally, most TCS graduate and postgraduate students on the platform treat their Twitter accounts as almost extensions of their LinkedIn pages, with their bios containing their academic interests as well as current or previous job positions and institutions, in some order (<a href="https://twitter.com/wjmzbmr1">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Santho_Velusamy">2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sitanch">3</a>).  In accordance with this initial observation, their posts themselves are also relatively inoffensive.  Some different types of posts I’ve seen are explainer <a href="https://twitter.com/fermi_ma/status/1463296409545830403">threads</a> of their own papers, <a href="https://twitter.com/henryquantum/status/1478162344228241408">comments</a> on others papers, <a href="https://twitter.com/WeinNicole/status/1518998504043122690">publicity graphics</a> for upcoming lectures, <a href="https://twitter.com/WeinNicole/status/1496551559286738946">advice</a> to people considering entering the field,  general encouragement and <a href="https://twitter.com/fermi_ma/status/1296097340198027265">congratulations</a> for exciting results or projects, and field-related <a href="https://twitter.com/leezabuh/status/1393023859184476161">jokes</a> or life updates (Ma, Yuen, Wein, Wein, Ma, Yang).  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Occasionally, graduate and postgraduate students do talk about potentially controversial issues like equity within the field, however all of these take relatively inoffensive stances.  To illustrate, a few graduate students posted about the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) conference, one of the biggest annual conferences in TCS, spotlighting its lack of <a href="https://twitter.com/sparsamir/status/1488601037254635520">accessibility</a> earlier this year (Mirtaheri).  In contrast, Theoretical Computer Science professors often use their platforms to talk about more controversial political issues that are semi-relevant to their fields.  For example, Harvard Professor Boaz Barak has used his platform recently to talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1499767568629833732">zoning laws</a> in Berkeley, <a href='https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1500871839748435975'>mask mandates</a> at Harvard, and <a href='https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1521212825053630464'>math education</a> in California, using rather confrontational language in the first and third cases (Barak). </p>
                <br>
                <p>Although there are occasionally conflicts with external sources, the tone of interactions within the field is overwhelmingly kind, supportive, and cordial (<a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1512433699463200769">Barak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/henryquantum/status/1478162344228241408">Yuen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/huckbennett/status/1473058035484356610">Bennett</a>).  An example of a recent external conflict is one between UC Berkeley computer science professor Jelani Nelson and Stanford education professor Joanne Boaler.  After Professor Nelson <a href="https://twitter.com/minilek/status/1509678967472549889">tweeted</a> about Professor Boaler’s exorbitant consulting fees for districts with large minority populations and criticized her role as a coauthor of the California Math Framework, Professor Boaler <a href="https://twitter.com/minilek/status/1511358525179453440">threatened</a> him with police and legal action (Nelson).  This initial conflict made waves throughout TCS Twitter, with many academics coming out in support of Professor Nelson and posting their own <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1519340969308475392">critiques</a> of the California Math Framework (CMF), which proposes measures like removing Algebra 2 in favor of Data Science and not including homework as a part of grading. All of this discussion culminated in an <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/mathindatamatters/home'>open letter</a> signed by over 400 academics across four-year institutions in California, and the discussion is still ongoing (Barak).  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In spite of the encroachments that personal opinions and disputes make into Theoretical Computer Science Twitterthe consensus in the interviews I conducted was, overwhelmingly, that Twitter remains a useful tool for academics in theoretical computer science to keep up to date with the latest discoveries and events, as well as to amplify results that they think people in the field should know about (G/PG 1, Prof 1, Prof 2).  Although there exist free, open-access archives of scholarly articles like arxiv.org and the Arxiv is actively used by people in the field (UG 1, Prof 1, Prof 2), Twitter allows for the ability to filter through all the papers and find the ones that are endorsed by people whose opinions are important (UG 1, Prof 2).  Even undergraduates interested in going to graduate school for theoretical computer science who don’t contribute much to the conversation lurk on the pages of heavy hitters keep up to date with their opinions (UG 1, G/PG 1).

                <h2>Climate Science Twitter</h2>
                <p>Compared to Theoretical Computer Science Twitter, Climate Science Twitter was a bit harder to find.  I stumbled for a few days around Climate Activist Twitter, Climate Nonprofit Twitter, and Climate Author Twitter before realizing that Climate Author Twitter was a part of Climate Science Twitter.  I was so used to what Theoretical Computer Science Twitter looked like that I had been looking for an analogous format in Climate Science Twitter, but the most active members of the field – the ones whose accounts I was able to find with a simple search –  did not use the platform in the same way (ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann">Mann</a>).  On TCS Twitter, the most popular discourse was very focused around new research and upcoming events.  The accounts of widely-followed professors on Climate Science Twitter, however, contain a lot more publicity posts for personal projects and appearances.  These include <a href="https://twitter.com/RosimarWx/status/1522969240944267266">television</a> appearances, published <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1520757379037544448">books</a> on climate change, and opinion <a href="https://twitter.com/JEBistline/status/1513561088075337735">pieces</a> written for major publications (Rios-Berrios, Mann, Bistline). </p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, the accounts of professors looked very different from the accounts of graduate/postgraduate students in the level of personal content that was posted and the involvement in controversial causes.  The accounts of professors and the accounts of graduate/postgraduate students on Climate Science Twitter are different, but in a different way from the accounts of professors and graduate/postgraduate students on TCS Twitter.  Professors’ profiles are a natural evolution of graduate and postgraduate students’ profiles.  While professors tweet often about their climate advocacy-related projects and appearances, graduate and postgraduate students’ profiles tend to be less focused on outreach and more focused on <a href="https://twitter.com/YueDong35680721">exclusively professional</a> interactions within the field, or on <a href="https://twitter.com/arianaelena97">advocacy</a> for graduate/postgraduate students within the field.  This dynamic makes sense, as the title of "professor" brings with it much more clout than the title of graduate/postgraduate student, and Professors naturally have had more time within the field to develop their reputations and opinions.  As it is for theoretical computer science, the exclusively professional accounts are likely an attempt to remain uncontroversial, so as to not damage future job prospects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Observationally, there also wasn’t much discussion between professors and graduate/postgraduate students about climate science.  The primary interactions I saw were <a href="https://twitter.com/scubasanchez/status/1501299817363902470">congratulations</a> for new papers and <a href="https://twitter.com/OceansClimateCU/status/1507044725966004247">announcements</a> that a student was joining a professors group in the near future (Sanchez, Karnauskas).  Similarly to Theoretical Computer Science Twitter, there were also <a href="https://twitter.com/cristiproist/status/1438556265974796291">job postings</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CinTyLeeEarth/status/1467691339240325124">advice</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonaMeiler/status/1508370599038574592">explainer threads</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/oceandreaFSU/status/1470816699196784641">advertisements</a> for lectures, and other professional use cases (Proistosescu, Lee, Meiler, Moore), however, there was an overall feeling of detachment within the space. Although people would retweet each other’s academic content, there’s little actual discussion about said content. In addition, when Professor 3 attempted to ask another academic about his work, he was condescending and many of his followers blocked Professor 3, indicating a lack of good faith in discourse (Prof 3).</p>
                <br>
                <p>The skew of Climate Science Twitter towards the personal and political is a natural result of its proximity to the climate crisis.  Considering the large public interest in climate science due to the climate crisis (whether people believe it’s real or not), the focus of Climate Science Twitteron outreach rather than internal discussion makes sense.  With a public platform like Twitter with the ability to reach large crowds of very different people, there’s an urge to contribute to the broader social discussion of the field and write your tweets in a more generally consumable way. As a result of this skew, there is a sentiment that Climate Science Twitter is not worth being a part of (G/PG 2). For some academics in the field, the benefits and community were not worth the politics of the platform.  </p>

            <section id='comparisons'>
                
                <h2>Comparisons</h2>
                <p>There was a noticeable difference in my interactions with the two fields during the interview process.  My TCS interviewees were very open with their responses and quick to respond.  For the first couple, I didn’t think to ask if they wanted anonymity, and they never requested it.  The others only accepted anonymity when I suggested it as an option.  From my climate science interviewees, however, there was an observed reticence to speak with me and active requests for anonymity from those who did.  In one case, an interviewee even backed out of our discussions after I insisted that I would need to cite that his field of research was climate science in my paper.  It was overall exceedingly more difficult for me to source interviews from climate science academics.  The undergraduate students I spoke to who were interested in pursuing further education in the field all mentioned that they avoided that area of Twitter because it had a tendency to make them disheartened about the state of people’s attitudes towards climate change, and the professors and graduate students I reached out to either didn’t respond, weren’t particularly active on Twitter, or simply refused to be interviewed.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>The disparity between TCS academics and climate science academics in the willingness to associate their names or positions with their thoughts indicated to me that the increased scrutiny and interest of outside parties like journalists, news outlets, and trolls in climate science due to the proximity of the field to relevant controversial issues was fostering in climate science academics a general fear of being perceived and wariness in stating their opinions that didn’t exist for TCS academics.  Although there are issues like diversity programs and support for minorities and people of color that cause divides within the TCS Twitter community, academics who exclusively tweet about that are usually not interacted with by the rest of the community. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Take, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Pedro Domingos</a>, a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington.  He often tweets about “wokeness” and laments  affirmative action.  Although he has a pretty large following of 48.5 thousand people, his Twitter account is not interacted with by other prominent figures in the TCS Twitter community.  In contrast, the rest of the community retweets and comments on each others’ content often, usually to <a href="https://twitter.com/aloni_bologna/status/1470519659975692290<">share</a> exciting results and opportunities, to announce <a href="https://twitter.com/anupamg/status/1479240308277796867">logistical</a> information about conferences, or to express sincere <a href="https://twitter.com/minilek/status/1498847116373884930">congratulations</a> (Cohen, Gupta, Nelson).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In Climate Science Twitter as well, there are very few controversial figures (G/PG 2), and those figures are usually kept on the fringes of the community.  An example of this is Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/DorianAbbot">Dorian Abbott</a>, a geophysicist at the University of Chicago.  He often Tweets his thoughts on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs being <a href="https://twitter.com/DorianAbbot/status/1425881669920301065">unethical</a> and the “unfortunate” new <a href="https://twitter.com/DorianAbbot/status/1518222934690652162">“wokeness”</a> of academic institutions (Abbott).  Again, however, characters like Professor Abbot are kept on the fringe of real academic discourse on Twitter.  In spite of this, Climate Science Twitter still does not have the same supportive, academic-focused community that Theoretical Computer Science Twitter has.  This indicates that it’s not internal controversy that’s inhibiting online discourse, but an external factor.  Due to the increased searchability and viewability of content in an online context and the resultant ability of invisible audiences to view and engage with this content, the fear of perception that I was able to identify in my interviewees offline seems to be only amplified online – inhibiting the Climate Science community on Twitter from engaging with each other in the same way that a more invisible community like TCS Twitter is able to.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is also some concern over the fact that figures like Professor Domingos and Professor Abbott are not interacted with by the rest of their respective communities (G/PG 2).  Although I do not support their views on affirmative action or diversity and inclusion initiatives, the idea that they’re being kept out of discourse in a field that their work is contributing to is concerning for the diversity of perspectives needed in academics, especially in more subjective fields like Climate Science (by subjective I mean that there is more room for differing opinions, as compared to a proof-based field like theoretical computer science where you can be right, wrong, or unknown).  This impact of personal views that aren’t directly relevant to their field of study on their ability to interact with other members of their fields online is a relatively concerning byproduct of the blurring of professional and personal. It’s, unfortunately, a natural effect of the move of professional discourse into such a public space on such an intrinsically personal platform.</p>

            <section id='conclusion'>
                
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, due to its closer proximity to social causes, Climate Science Twitter serves as less of a space for academic discourse and networking than Theoretical Computer Science Twitter does.  Instead, it is more of a space for advocacy.  The affordances of Twitter make it useful as a hub of discourse and information dissemination for some academic fields, but its inherent role as a public forum can turn it into more of a space for outreach for fields that are closer to social causes, reducing its ability to be used as a discussion forum catering to a specific group of people.  Twitter’s public nature can also deter academics from joining the space.  In cases where public interest in the academic field is high, the fear of negative perception can outweigh convenience of discourse with other academics.  This leaves the space to people who are willing and able to do outreach work and, by leaving out those who aren’t, reduces the capacity of academic Twitter for interesting, productive discourse.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>What, then, does all of this mean for the future of academic Twitter? Is it healthier for academica to do away with the concept altogether? Would it be more productive to create a new platform for academic discourse alone? Are the benefits that academic discourse on Twitter confers worth the exclusionary effects? All of these are questions to consider as the landscape of networked publics continues to evolve. </p>
