            <h1>Professor 3</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <br>
                <p> I primarily use Twitter to stay informed about labor organizing, new science in and out of my field, teaching innovations, the disabled community, and climate justice. I typically tweet about graduate student support--the union, financial support, mental health, etc. I will also retweet opportunities that I know are good ones (conferences, job openings).</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is this account the same as your personal twitter?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">When did you make this account? For what purpose?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I made this account in 2017 for the purpose of promoting the Kickstarter for my children's book about climate change. I started my Twitter for climate outreach.</p>

                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter impacted the way you learn about your field/come up with new ideas for papers?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What about keeping up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">How has Twitter impacted your real-life interactions with others in your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Not really</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is using Twitter common for your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>t's not very common, but climate scientists do use it to communicate about their science and also about environmental advocacy. Younger scientists tend to be on Twitter more and they will announce new papers which is always fun to see.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>About the climate science community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the climate sciene community on twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since I'm not on Twitter to follow climate science, really, I have some trouble with judging this. I think there's a fairly large community of people, but only a few particularly impactful accounts.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why do you decide to like/retweet tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p>If the answer to "Will it be helpful to students?" is a fairly unambiguous and resounding yes, I will like or retweet.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Are there politics on TCS twitter? Beef? Subsections that elicit strong/any emotional reactions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have honest questions about a scholar's work. When I asked him about it, he first was condescending and then refused to answer. When I pressed him for an answer, I was blocked by a bunch of his followers. I stopped engaging with the climate community after that. I only interact with folks I know in person. It's not worth putting up with the climate denying trolls to then also get people on the right side of history angry with me. In the meantime, a research scientist in my group will soon be submitting a paper that's basically saying this scholar was wrong, so I feel vindicated. Sometimes anger can be highly motivating. As for subgroups, yes there are the "What about"er climate change deniers, the climate doomerism crowd, the you should bike everywhere folks, the geoengineering community, ... I don't have the emotional energy for most of it.</p>
