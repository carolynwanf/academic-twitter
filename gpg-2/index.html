                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I do use Twitter, where I run an ironic anonymous account. I tweet to express my negatuve thoughts and complaints about academica and life. Sorry, I can't share my handle.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter impacted the way you learn about your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Twitter has not impacted how I learn about my field, becuase I mostly avoid "legitimate" academic Twitter. In general, I find academic Twitter very, very cringe. Partially because people are often humble-bragging about their research, trying to be unique and quirky, and it also seems highly identity-driven.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What about keeping up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I think Twitter is quite good as a way to keep up to date with scientific discoveries, because people often do Tweet about their new publications. However, for the reasons above, I avoid it. Google Scholar notifications help me keep up-tp-date on new papers in a more straighforward fashion. So you dont <emph>need</emph> Twitter to stay up to date, there are other ways.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">How has Twitter impacted your real-life interactions with others in your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>It hasn't strongly affected my real-life interactions for the reasons above.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>About the Climate Science community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the Climate Science community on Twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I think the science Twitter community is very generic and boring. Everybody tweets the same, thinks the same, and designs their profiles the same. Very uninspiring. There is a certain norm for how one should behave as a mainstream "academic tweeter" to fit in, and I can't recall seeing many people who break awat from these templates. It's hard to totally explain, but you see the patterns once you've seen enough. Typical posts: "Check out this new paper by me and colleagues! Super cool!" Or "White privilege is a huge problem in our field". During COVID a lot of scientific Twitter people would just tweet endlessly about COVID. A lot of people post job openings on Twitter these days. I think a lot of these are legitimate social issues, but I just think these tweets are very superficial and not helping solve any problems, more about fitting in.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although...Dorian Abbott is very contrarian on Twiter and often gets into massive beef with mainstream academic Twitter users. Actually, he was cancelled last year for his tweets, amongst other things. People like him only get retweeted by alt-right conservatives and Fox news-like media outlets, Often times, student activies go onto Twitter and do battle with Dorian. People like Dorian are totally Shunner my mainstream acadeimc Twitter, so I think they feel they have no choice but to go to Fox News and conservatives to get support. This causes them to lose credibility and people to hate them even more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would say I am Dorian-neutral, but anti-Dorian cancellation. I think he should be able to express his viewpoints on affirmative action with getting his scientific lecture/award cancelled.</p>
