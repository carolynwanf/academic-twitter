                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I don't participate bc I don't have a Twitter but I certainly do catch up on their tweets from time to time</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Whose tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Boaz is very active so I'll click on things he posts/people he tags. I usually end up on academic Twitter through Boaz though, because I follow his academic blog and he taught my class and he’s my academic advisor, so we interact more”</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also lurk on the pages of cool quantum information people, some random walk over people Boaz interacts with, etc. If I end up on academic Twitter I’ll click through to a bunch of people I know who are relevant (e.g. Boaz, Anurag, Henry Yuen, Peter Short, Aram Harrow, etc.)</p>
                <br>

            <div>
                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter impacted the way you learn about your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Definitely yeah, Twitter is a service where people interact and where people are pretty honest. I can read all these papers but on Twitter all these actual scientists are interacting as people and talking to each other in a very natural way. It's a good way to see who is in this field and who they are as people. The people whose pages I check regularly, they postly post TCS related things but there’s also adjacent things (ex. representation in CS)</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What about keeping up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Definitely! If a finding is very influential, someone will tweet about it. There’s the arxiv, and I follow that, but I don’t know enough to understand what’s good and what’s not. Endorsements of work are very useful.</p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About the TCS community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the TCS community on Twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The people I know personally are at Harvard, and it seems like a pretty small group who interact and know each other. The conversation seems dominated by faculty.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Are there politics on TCS Twitter? Beef? Subsections that elicit strong/any emotional reactions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’m pretty sure there is, but even if people have beef offline they're pretty civil on Twitter. Academic Twitter feels like a professional forum and people keep things civil. There are external conflicts though, like the thing with Jelani and that Stanford professor.</p>
