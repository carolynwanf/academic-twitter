                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most of my tweets are to share information about new research results that excite me, whether my own or someone else's. I sometimes also share details of outreach programs I'm involved in.</p>
                <p class="question">Is this account the same as your personal Twitter?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">When did you make this account? For what purpose?</p>
                <br>
                <p>February 2009. I was not active on Twitter until semi recently (I almost didn't use it at all until Fall 2019).</p>
                <br>

            <div>
                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter impacted the way you learn about your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Learn about my field: somewhat. Sometimes I notice interesting papers being tweeted by colleagues. It's not the only way I learn about new work though. I'm in an international Slack group with over 100 members of my research community, and people post links to new, interesting papers. I also check arXiv frequently.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What about keeping up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">How has Twitter impacted your real-life interactions with others in your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>A little bit. Sometimes they're aware of things happening in my life or in my research via what they read on Twitter.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is using Twitter common for your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would say there are many Twitter users in my field, but there are also many people in my field who don't use Twitter or any form of social media at all.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About the TCS community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the TCS community on Twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>TCS is large and has many sub-communities. Some communities seem to be more active on Twitter than others (e.g., differential privacy).</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why do you decide to like/retweet tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p> generally 'like' tweets to show my support. I 'retweet' when I think others who follow me would be interested in learning more about what that tweet has to say.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Are there politics on TCS Twitter? Beef? Subsections that elicit strong/any emotional reactions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>There's definitely politics on Twitter, but I haven't really seen TCS-related politics on Twitter.</p>
