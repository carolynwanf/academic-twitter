                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses Twitter to broadcast new papers</li>
                    <li>Summaries and explainers to a general TCS audience, not necessarily TCS academics in their specific field</li>
                    <li>Replies to things and clarifies misunderstandings</li>
                    <li>Retweeted a talk announcement for his advisor</li>
                    <li>Will retweet something because they knows person in some capacity (job postings, talks)</li>
                    <li>Retweets to validate a person</li>
                    <li>Retweets with the intention to “amplify good people”</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="question">Is this account the same as your personal twitter?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes, I only Tweet from my academic Twitter</li>
                    <li>I follow news things and use  it to browse</li>
                    <li>I don't tweet about personal or political things, but it would be different if I weren't currently a graduate student/postdoc</li>
                    <li>I care what people think about me and the job market</li>
                    <li>It's intellectually easier to not have to think about if someone is gonna be annoyed on your thoughts about housing policy</li>
                    <li>I don’t tweet non academic things, but if i were a professor I’d feel differently</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="question">When did you make this account? For what purpose?</p>
                <br>
                <p>One day I realized I had Twitter</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Did you purge your Twitter of personal tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I never tweeted personal things</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What are you looking to do when you summarize your papers in threads?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The intended audience is TCS academics, they assume baseline knowledge and that the content wouldn't be interesting to someone with no TCS background</p>
                <br>
                <p>An explainer thread is published right after the paper is posted. The thread is drafted before the paper is posted and run by coauthors to make sure they're “not saying anything blatantly false”</p>

                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has twitter impacted the way you learn about your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>They hear about general news in TCS sooner than they would’ve otherwise. For example, the deadline for FOCS is hard to find, they only know when it is because of Twitter</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Has twitter impacted the way you come up with new ideas?</p>
                <br>
                <p>No, not at all</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">What about keeping up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes, but this is not true for everyone. It's not often that you start a collaboration through a Twitter thread, but they've seen it before. Their specific sub-community of TCS Twitter is not on Twitter as much</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">How has Twitter impacted your real-life interactions with others in your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>It hasn't</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is using Twitter common for your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>No</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About the TCS community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the TCS community on twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's pretty positive and supportive. They haven’t really seen arguments. Anything you post is linked to your name forever and academia is very reputation based, so people only wanna show best side. Academics will privately say that a paper is bad or its methodology is silly, and people will complain online about anonymous reviews but not about spcific papers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There's a diplomatic tone when debunking, and lots of effort goes into preserving this tone. People are wrong all the time, so it's better way to operate to be generous in criticism. Judgements on what’s interesting are central to academia and can be controversial, but people keep negative opinions to themselves more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most of the people are between 25-55, usually younger professors, grad students, and postdocs. There are also lurking undergrads, who don't sat much because they both haven't done much and can be intimidated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is some correlation between academic success and Twitter success, but it's not that strong. It's more correlated with how much you post fun facts, cool techniques, and explainers.</p>
                <p class="question">Why do you decide to like/retweet tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p>They will like non-controversial things. "No saucy takes".</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Are there politics on TCS twitter? Beef? Subsections that elicit strong/any emotional reactions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is definitely beef between academics, but it's not usually hashed out on Twitter. More often there are thoughts on practices in the community, advice for writing papers, general wisdom, and paper threads. When target of anger is not person, people will express their anger.</p>
