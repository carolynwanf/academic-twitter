            <div>
                <h2>About your Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">What do you use your Twitter for?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I use Twitter to both learn about what's going on in my academic field, related fields, and in the world at large. I also use it to amplify results or issues I think people in my circle should know about, as well as announce papers, job openings, seminars, etc. at my institution.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is this account the same as your personal Twitter?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">When did you make this account? For what purpose?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I created it initially in January 2020 to both get more information about new papers, and pretty soon after to also follow the latest news on Covid. Initially I was just using it to follow and read, but at some point started posting myself.</p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About work and Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter impacted the way you learn about your field/come up with new ideas for papers?</p>
                <p class="question">Has Twitter helped you keep up to date with new discoveries?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Let me answer both these questions together. Twitter is definitely useful for me to learn about new discoveries. There are too many papers posted on the Arxiv for me to follow, and so seeing what papers are exciting for people in my area, or reading very short summaries of such papers, is very useful. I don't know if it directly helps me to come up with new ideas, but obviously keeping abreast of developments is often useful for that.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">How has Twitter impacted your real-life interactions with others in your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>For much of the time I was on Twitter we had a pandemic, and so real-life interactions were very limited :) While I've interacted with many people in my field through conferences and other meetings, there are some people that I've interacted mostly through Twitter, and so if I meet them, probably it will impact the interaction.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Is using Twitter common for your field?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I work on both theoretical CS and theory of machine learning. It's very common in machine learning, and becoming more common in TCS.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>About the TCS community on Twitter:</h2>
                <p class="question">How would you characterize the TCS community on Twitter (eg. size, kinds of people, attitudes, dynamics)?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I think many TCS people are not on Twitter, but the few that do are a pretty friendly community. (This is not necessarily the same for larger communities, including machine learning.)</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Why do you decide to like/retweet tweets?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I typically retweet/like if I either think it is something that deserves amplification, or if the Tweet contains useful information that I might want to come back to in the future (so sometimes use "like" as a form of bookmarks).</p>
                <br>
                <p class="question">Are there politics on TCS Twitter? Beef? Subsections that elicit strong/any emotional reactions?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Politics is part of life, and certainly people tweet about political issues, especially when they are salient in the broader society (e.g., elections, the war in Ukraine, etc..). I've seen academics get into arguments, but can't remember something like that with both participants inside the TCS community.</p>
